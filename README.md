# cariaco_basin
Scripts for analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela. To view the code used for this analysis, click here: https://d-mcgrath.github.io/cariaco_basin/

Data required to re-run the analyses are available in the cariaco_github_data_small folder. Some data files that are too large to host on GitHub will be made available on OSF in a repository.
