# Diverse secondary metabolites are expressed in particle-associated and free-living microorganisms of the permanently anoxic Cariaco Basin

Scripts for analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela. To view the code used for this analysis, click here: https://d-mcgrath.github.io/cariaco_basin/

Data required to re-run the analyses are available in the [cariaco_github_data_small](https://github.com/d-mcgrath/cariaco_basin/tree/main/cariaco_github_data_small) folder. Some data files that are too large to host on GitHub will be made available on OSF in a repository. Conda environments required for parts of the analysis are in the [yaml_files_for_analysis](https://github.com/d-mcgrath/cariaco_basin/tree/main/yaml_files_for_analysis) folder.
