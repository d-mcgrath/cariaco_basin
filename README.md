Scripts for analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela. To view the code used for this analysis, click here: https://d-mcgrath.github.io/cariaco_basin/

Data required to re-run the analyses are available in the [cariaco_github_data_small](https://github.com/d-mcgrath/cariaco_basin/tree/main/cariaco_github_data_small) folder. Some data files that are too large to host on GitHub are available on OSF in a folder "Large GitHub files" in the following repository: https://osf.io/usm8r/. Conda environments required to reproduce this analysis are in the [yaml_files_for_analysis](https://github.com/d-mcgrath/cariaco_basin/tree/main/yaml_files_for_analysis) folder.
